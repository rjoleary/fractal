Fractal
=======

This is a short program that renders an interactive Mandelbrot Set. There will
be other types of fractals comming soon if I have time.


Compiling
---------

Compiling the source is pretty easy. In linux, run `make`. First, you may need
to install the `cimg-dev` and `xorg-dev` packages. Under Ubuntu, I use:

    sudo apt-get install cimg-dev xorg-dev

In Windows, download the CImg header file into you include directory. It can
obtained from the [CImg website](http://cimg.sourceforge.net/). Copy all the
source files (cpp/hpp) into a Visual C++ solution and compile.
